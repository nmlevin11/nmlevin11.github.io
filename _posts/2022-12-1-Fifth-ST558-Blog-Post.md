I have learned many things in ST558 that will be valuable in the future and will impact how I do things in practice. I learned a lot about R, RStudio, and R Markdown that will help me program better in the future and will improve my documentation when I do program in the future. I learned about the Tidyverse and ggplot which will impact the ways that I manipulate data and create plots using R in the future. I’ll also put more thought into exploratory data analysis and variable selection methods next time I am presented with that task.
 
When I look to how I may use data science and statistics in the future, there are some unknowns related to whether I will choose to make a career pivot into a role that is directly related to my new education or if I choose to instead continue on my chemical engineering path using my new education as an extra set of tools at my disposal. Either way, I expect to use the data science skills of manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing data wherever the future takes me. I’d like to learn more about other predictive model options in the future. Seeing how many options are available in the caret package makes it very clear that there is so much out there that I don’t know about.
